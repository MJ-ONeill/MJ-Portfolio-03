            I have a passion for coding I do not do this because it is trendy do be a developer or because it gives a
            good payday, I
            actually love the entire process from the planning too the frustrating debugging and that feeling just after
            a successful
            release even the stress in between I have been in love with this wonderful world since I was a kid and MsDos
            was still a
            thing. I am Seeking entry-level opportunities to expand skills while facilitating company growth I am a fast
            learner and
            detailed orientated and I am not afraid to start at the bottom and work my way up.
